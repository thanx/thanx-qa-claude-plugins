# Development Guidelines

## Plugin Structure

```
plugins/qa/
  .claude-plugin/plugin.json   # Plugin manifest
  commands/*.md                # Slash commands
  agents/*.md                  # Agents (launched via Task() from commands)
  skills/*/SKILL.md            # Knowledge bases
```

## Writing Commands

- Every command file must start with YAML frontmatter containing a `description` field
- Use numbered steps (## Step 1, ## Step 2, etc.)
- Reference `$ARGUMENTS` to access user input
- Keep each step deterministic and measurable

## Writing Agents

- Frontmatter must include `description` and `capabilities`
- Define clear input/output contracts
- Include "When to Use This Agent" and "Process" sections

## Writing Skills

- One directory per skill, with a `SKILL.md` inside
- Skills are reference material, not executable workflows
- Keep content factual and up to date

## Verification Commands

Run before every PR, in this order:

```bash
# 1. Markdown lint
npm run lint:md

# 2. Link validation (internal and external)
npm run test:links

# 3. Schema + frontmatter validation
npm test

# 4. Full plugin validation
npm run validate
```

All four must pass. Fix before pushing.

### Common Failures

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Missing frontmatter | New .md file without YAML header | Add `---\ndescription: ...\n---` |
| Trailing whitespace | Markdown lint rule MD009 | Run `npm run lint:md:fix` |
| Broken link | Reference to moved/deleted file | Update the link target |
| Schema error | Invalid JSON in plugin.json | Check JSON syntax |

## Testing

Run `npm test` before every PR. Tests validate:

- JSON schema correctness (`.mcp.json`, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`)
- YAML frontmatter presence on commands and agents
- Markdown structure (title heading, no trailing whitespace, no consecutive blank lines)
- Link validity (internal and external)
